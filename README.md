# Lusco

It is a web project intended to clone Google.

My goal was to learn tailwind by recreating the design in my own way.

It was a great experience. This site was refactored and Next.js + Typescript were added to it.

Now it use Redux toolkit and RTK queries.

The API used is: https://rapidapi.com/apigeek/api/google-search3/.
